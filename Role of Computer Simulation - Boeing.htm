 turn time -- the time required to unload an airplane after its arrival 
at the gate and to prepare it for departure again -- has increased since
 the mid-1970s. Boeing has created a computer simulation that can help 
airlines reduce one of the key elements of turn time: passenger boarding
 (enplaning and deplaning). Decreasing passenger boarding time may 
significantly lower the amount of time between revenue flights, and so 
increase profitability to airlines. </font><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">As
 airlines face increasing pressure to improve profitability, they are 
striving to carry the greatest number of passengers feasible while 
keeping their fleets in revenue service as much as possible -- all 
without compromising passenger convenience. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">One
 way airlines can move toward this goal is to reduce airplane turn time.
 Turn time is the time required to unload an airplane following arrival 
at a gate and to ensure that the airplane is ready and loaded for its 
next departure. The most significant elements of turn time include 
passenger enplaning and deplaning, cargo loading and unloading, airplane
 fueling, cabin cleaning, and galley servicing. <a href="#fig1">(figure 1)</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">For
 many airlines the largest factor in turn time is the passenger boarding
 process. Boeing has conducted studies to help understand the airplane's
 contribution to turn time. The company is continually working with 
customer airlines to develop the data and tools necessary to help reduce
 turn time without significantly affecting passenger convenience.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">During its studies, Boeing considered the following:<br>1 Historical trends.<br>2 Existing turn time documentation.<br>3 Computer simulation tools.<br>4 Discrete event simulation.<br>5 Simulation validation and testing.<br>6 Applications of computer simulation.<br></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">1 HISTORICAL TRENDS<br>The
 majority of the standard body fleet has been experiencing a gradual 
increase in airplane turn time since 1975. A useful indicator is the 
airlines' reported increase in through-stop times, the ground time 
required for flights continuing on to other destinations. <a href="#fig2">(figure 2)</a>
 Increased turn time is further substantiated by Boeing boarding rate 
studies. Since 1970, the actual speed at which passengers boarded an 
airplane (enplane rate) has slowed by more than 50 percent, down to as 
low as 9 passengers per minute. <a href="#fig3">(figure 3)</a> Similar 
through-stop time increases and boarding rates have been observed for 
wide-body airplanes. The trends are generally attributed to increased 
passenger carry-on luggage, more emphasis on passenger convenience, 
passenger demographics, airline service strategies, and airplane flight 
distance (stage length). Boeing believes that these trends will continue
 unless the root causes are understood and new tools and processes are 
developed to reverse the trend.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">2 EXISTING TURN TIME DOCUMENTATION<br>Boeing
 has documented airplane turn time, including the passenger loading 
process, for many years. This documentation describes the "generic" flow
 time expected for each airplane. <a href="#fig1">(figure 1)</a> The 
information helps an airline schedule ground times and establish 
airplane ground handling procedures. However, the general nature of this
 information does not help airlines evaluate alternative procedures that
 could shorten flow time or help the airlines predict the impact of 
these procedures on passenger convenience. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">3 COMPUTER SIMULATION<br>Boeing
 developed a computer simulation model to help airlines reduce turn 
time. This model analyzes the impact of interior configuration changes 
and variations in passenger boarding procedures on the passenger 
boarding process. The simulation can quantify potential changes that an 
airline would normally identify only through costly and potentially 
disruptive in-service experiments. Though using the model does not 
completely eliminate the need to conduct passenger loading trials, it 
can effectively quantify the expected outcome. This allows the airline 
to limit in-service trials. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Called
 the Boeing Passenger Enplane/Deplane Simulation (PEDS), this simulation
 helps the user evaluate different passenger boarding scenarios and 
airplane interior configurations. The simulation: </font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"> 	<li>Calculates passenger loading and unloading time, allowing the airline to conduct turn time trade studies analytically. 	</li><li>Allows
 individual factors such as interior configuration, passenger mix, and 
boarding scenarios to  be varied and then estimates the expected time 
savings.  	</li><li>Evaluates potential changes to interior configurations. 	</li><li>Evaluates the effect of passenger behaviors associated with different traveling populations.  	</li><li>Helps quantify the effect of passenger behavior variations that an airline may encounter over time.</li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">4 DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION<br>PEDS
 analyzes the passenger boarding process as a set of interrelated 
elements through a technique called discrete event simulation. This 
modeling technique uses computer software to combine the effects of 
mathematical queuing theory with an analysis of random behavior. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Random
 behavior associated with passenger loading can occur either in activity
 timing (when events happen) or in action decisions (how people act). 
The more complex the overall activities are, the more difficult it is to
 accurately predict the impacts of the random behavior. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Boeing
 began using discrete event simulation to understand interactions in the
 factory environment. In 1994, Boeing started applying the discrete 
event model in passenger boarding studies. PEDS assigns each passenger 
certain attributes, such as walking speed, type of carry-on luggage, 
luggage put-away time, and relationship with other passengers (traveling
 alone or with a group). The simulation accounts for random behavior by 
applying probability distributions to passenger attributes. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">In
 discrete event simulations, each activity happens at specific 
intervals. The activity starts, continues for a finite period of time, 
then stops. Similar to a car passing along a city street, each airplane 
passenger enters the cabin and "travels" to his assigned seat. Various 
other activities, such as passengers standing in the aisle, assisting 
family members, or waiting to store luggage in the overhead bins, act as
 traffic lights that prevent passengers from speeding through the cabin 
to their seats. PEDS breaks down the passenger loading process into a 
series of finite elements of starting, moving, stopping, waiting, and 
restarting, beginning with the moment the first passenger enters the 
cabin and ending when the last passenger is seated. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">In
 the computer model, engineers use the software to create a mathematical
 scene of the interior of the airplane, complete with seats, overhead 
bins, aisles, and doors. Each passenger is individually modeled and 
assigned attributes that describe some segment of the traveling 
population. The simulation then governs the decisions of each passenger 
based on these attributes and the timing of each event (waiting or 
moving) as he or she passes through the cabin.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">In
 addition to varying passenger "speed," the simulation allows variation 
in other attributes. Each run of the simulation calculates the total 
elapsed time and provides visibility into the various "choke" points 
identified by the scenario. To eliminate statistical bias, multiple 
simulations are run on the identical interior configuration using 
different random number starting points, and the results are then 
averaged over the multiple runs.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">The
 process begins by establishing a general airplane simulation. This 
simulation is then "tailored" using the airline's specific interior 
configuration, boarding procedures, and passenger demographics. A series
 of baseline runs is conducted to validate PEDS predictions with the 
airline's in-service experience. This turn time baseline allows the 
airline to evaluate potential changes to interior layout or boarding 
procedures against existing time lines.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">5 SIMULATION VALIDATIONAND TESTING<br>A
 simulation is valid only if it accurately predicts what happens during 
actual events. In order to validate PEDS, Boeing conducted two types of 
activities:</font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"> 	<li>In-service observation. 	</li><li>Actual passenger loading tests.</li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><b>In-service observation. </b><br>Boeing
 engineers observed revenue passenger loading activities with different 
airlines at several different airports around the world. The loading 
process was timed and correlated to simulation predictions. These 
exercises were conducted on a random basis so that timed data would be 
representative of actual experience. However, this method of validation 
had two limitations:</font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">	<li>It did not  allow observations of all the interac tions between passengers or with the air plane configu ration. 	</li><li>It only validated simulation predictions of  existing airline loading procedures.</li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><b>Actual passenger loading tests. </b><br>In order to provide additional information, Boeing conducted a series of passenger loading tests.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">The
 tests were conducted on a fully configured 757-200 airplane located in a
 Boeing factory. A loading platform was modified to simulate an airport 
passenger loading bridge, and a staging area was used to simulate an 
airport gate waiting area. Trained airline flight attendants used 
procedures inside the airplane and at the loading bridge that reflected 
actual airport and airline operations. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">A
 total of 600 non-Boeing people, representative of the typical traveling
 population, participated in the enplane/deplane tests. Each passenger 
was requested to bring carry-on luggage typical for a three- to 
four-hour flight. The passenger population was varied for each test, 
with each passenger participating in only two sets of enplane/deplane 
tests to prevent "learning"that could alter the test results. The 
following four enplane/ deplane scenarios were then run: </font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">	<li>Door 1 only.	</li><li>Door 2 only.	</li><li>Both Door 1 and Door 2.	</li><li>Both Door 1 and 2 with an  alternative passenger loading method called "outside-in."</li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">The
 outside-in scenario involves loading passengers at the window seats 
first, middle seats next, and aisle seats last. The outside-in test was 
designed to validate the simulation's ability to handle nontraditional 
procedures.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Each 
test was timed and videotaped for comparison with the simulation's 
predictions. Video cameras located on the loading bridge and throughout 
the passenger cabin recorded each test for later analysis.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">The
 tests showed that PEDS performed well in predicting both enplane and 
deplane times for each scenario. However, the videotapes documented some
 unexpected interaction among passengers during the loading process. For
 example, several passengers stowed their carry-on luggage in overhead 
bins located away from their seats. This happened while they were 
waiting behind people who were blocking the aisle, rather than waiting 
for the aisle to clear and then stowing their luggage when they reached 
their seats. This additional information allowed Boeing to refine PEDS 
to account for this type of behavior. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">6 APPLICATIONS OF THE COMPUTER SIMULATION<br>PEDS offers several applications both for airlines and for Boeing:</font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">	<li>Analysis of the impact of airplane interior configuration on turn time.	</li><li>Evaluation of potential changes to passenger loading procedures.</li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><b>Airplane interior configuration.</b>
 Both Boeing and the customer airline can use PEDS initially to help 
configure the airplane interior. PEDS improves their understanding of 
how a proposed configuration affects passenger loading. Passenger 
boarding times become part of interior configuration decisions, similar 
to decisions made about aesthetic appearance and passenger comfort.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><b>Evaluation of potential changes to passenger loading procedures. </b>The
 simulation also helps airlines evaluate potential changes to passenger 
loading procedures. Boarding alternatives such as outside-in, multiple 
preboarding, or even unassigned seating can be evaluated using an 
airline's target passenger population. Airlines can quantify potential 
savings without incurring the expense of boarding trials or risking 
passenger inconvenience. Airlines can use PEDS to evaluate even small 
procedural changes, such as increased involvement by flight attendants 
or emphasis on reduced passenger carry-on luggage. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Alternatives
 that show significant promise can then be tested in the field. PEDS 
helps airlines develop detailed implementation plans for new procedures 
and logistics needed to decrease turn time, including flight attendant 
training and airport logistics.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Boeing is currently working with a number of airlines to evaluate PEDS for their specific applications.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">SUMMARY<br>Decreased
 airplane turn time can positively affect airline profitability. A new 
computer simulation developed by Boeing offers airlines an analytical 
method for evaluating changes to airplane configuration or passenger 
loading techniques and their impact on airplane turn times. The 
simulation is a cost-effective tool to help airlines rapidly predict 
results with a high degree of success.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">--------------------------------------------------</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">GETTING HELP WITH TURN TIME REDUCTION<br>The
 Boeing Passenger Enplane/ Deplane Simulation (PEDS) offers airlines an 
additional tool to help reduce turn time. Depending on an individual 
airline's operation, other elements of turn time, such as cargo 
handling, cabin cleaning, or galley servicing, may also be improved.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Boeing
 has a team of turn time experts that can work with airlines to analyze 
specific areas of concern. Airlines interested in evaluating solutions 
to their turn time problems should contact their local Field Service or 
Customer Requirements representative for assistance.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">--------------------------------------------------</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">EVALUATING TURN TIME ON THE NEW 757-300<br>The
 initial application of the Boeing Passenger Enplane/Deplane Simulation 
(PEDS) was on the new 757-300 airplane. PEDS helps evaluate various 
passenger boarding scenarios to determine how to reduce airplane turn 
time.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">The 757-300 is
 a stretched derivative of the 757-200. It is 23 feet, 4 inches longer 
than its predecessor and holds approximately 40 more seats. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Several
 potential customers for the 757-300 had told Boeing that, based on 
their experience with other standard-body airplanes, they were concerned
 about the new airplane's potentially greater turn time. </font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Boeing
 used the 757-200 as a baseline for evaluating passenger boarding on the
 757-300. PEDS predicted that passenger loading for the 757-200 would 
take approximately 22 minutes and that deplaning would take about 10 
minutes. The predicted overall turn time for the 757-200 was 52.5 
minutes, including cargo handling, fueling, galley servicing, and cabin 
cleaning. The estimated time was based on actual airline in-service turn
 times for the 757.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Applying
 PEDS to a 757-300 dual-class configuration with 240 passengers showed 
that passenger loading would require 26 minutes, and that unloading 
would take about 12.5 minutes. The predicted overall turn time was 59 
minutes, an increase of only 6.5 minutes over the 757-200. <a href="#fig5a">(figure 5a)</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">Boeing
 then used PEDS to evaluate a number of alternative boarding scenarios. 
Simulation predictions were compared to the 757-200 passenger boarding 
test to validate results. Based on these validated predictions, it was 
possible to identify significant potential reductions to overall turn 
times for the 757-300. For example:</font></p><ul type="SQUARE"><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">	<li>Using Door 2 instead of Door 1, boarding time (enplaning and deplaning) was reduced by one minute. 	</li><li>Using Door 1 and Door 2  together saved five minutes. 	</li><li>If
 alternative loading procedures were used -- such as the "outside-in" 
method of loading (window seats first, middle seats next, and aisle 
seats last) -- the savings could be as great as 17 minutes. <a href="#fig5b">(figure 5b)</a></li></font></ul><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif">PEDS
 showed that the new 757-300 could be operated within the normal 757 
turn time window of 60 minutes without making notable changes to 
existing procedures. It also showed that turn time could be reduced 
significantly if airlines used alternative passenger boarding methods.</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><a name="fig1">figure 1</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><img src="Role%20of%20Computer%20Simulation%20-%20Boeing_files/tfig1.gif" border="0" height="322" width="594"><br><br><br><a name="fig2">figure 2</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><img src="Role%20of%20Computer%20Simulation%20-%20Boeing_files/tfig2.gif" border="0" height="309" width="496"><br><br><br><a name="fig3">figure 3</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><img src="Role%20of%20Computer%20Simulation%20-%20Boeing_files/tfig3.gif" border="0" height="313" width="494"><br><br><br><a name="fig5a">figure 5a</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><img src="Role%20of%20Computer%20Simulation%20-%20Boeing_files/tfig5a.gif" border="0" height="432" width="468"><br><br><br><a name="fig5b">figure 5b</a></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif"><img src="Role%20of%20Computer%20Simulation%20-%20Boeing_files/tfig5b.gif" border="0" height="338" width="522"><br><br><br></font><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Scott Marelli, P.E.</b><br>Senior Math/Modeling Analyst<br>Applied Research and Technology<br>Boeing Shared Services Group<br></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Gregory Mattocks</b><br>Lead Engineer<br>757 Configuration and Engineering Analysis<br>Boeing Commercial Airplane Group<br></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Remick Merry</b><br>Senior Specialist Engineer<br>New Airplane Customer Service<br>Boeing Commercial Airplane Group<br></font><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="1"></font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="1"><a href="#top">return to top</a>  | <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_01/textonly/textonly.html">AERO text-only contents</a> | <a href="http://www.boeing.com/" target="_top">Boeing Home</a> | <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/" target="_top">Commercial</a><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/aboutus/copyright.html" target="_top">Copyright</a> ©  The Boeing Company.
